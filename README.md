- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Viirfelloff. I fell off if you didn't notice.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in relearning the 4 languages I knew and then forgot......
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and C++; specifically for FTC SDK and competitive coding.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dont. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I skateboard :)
- My journey:
- I've also been coding since 6th grade on and off. My first language was javaScript, where i worked with microbits to make simple games
- Then, I learned about python and machine learning at a summer program and self taught myself kaboom.js on replit to develop my own games :)
- I continued throughout middle school, and this year, I started coding a lot more; I spent months learning the FTC SDK and Java, as I was new.
- Now, I'm starting to contribute to my team's code and am self-teaching C++ as a side project for eventual competitive coding!!!
